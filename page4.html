            <td>The circuit of my LED is powered by the Pin 1 on my Microbit, and is connected to the ground too. I have one wire from the P1 to the circuit board at + and another for the ground connected to my board at -. This supplies power to my breadboard as whenever I need power, I just use a wire to connect it to the negative and positive strips on the side, without having to use another long wire to connect it to my microbit. Then I put together my circuit using a diode, a transistor, multiple wires, and a resistor.
