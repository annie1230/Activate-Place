        <td colspan="2">Have you ever just wanted to have a secret hide out that no one knows of? Or do you store your precious belongings in your house? Well this secret door is just right for you. It is customizable by code, and very easy to change. If you want this secret door to be not so secret, just tell us! We charge no fees for minimal custom changes. This door is also automatic, with only a few buttons needing to be pressed.</td>

    <tr>
        <td><p>This system was created by code, microbit, and a servo. With three wires I connected each one (signal, power, ground) to their degsinated pins on the microbit. This then powers the microbit through my code showcased to the right. Through different inputs my microbit follows different sequences. My microbit is also what sends power through my circuit to light up my LED and spin my motor.</p></td>

    <td><p>Here, is a picture of my circuit. I connected the encoder of the servo to Pin 0, the power wire of the servo to pin 3V, and the ground pin to GND. That's essentially how my servo works. The circuit of my LED is powered by the Pin 1 on my Microbit, and is connected to the ground too. I have one wire from the P1 to the circuit board at + and another for the ground connected to my board at -. This supplies power to my breadboard as whenever I need power, I just use a wire to connect it to the negative and positive strips on the side, without having to use another long wire to connect it to my microbit. Then I put together my circuit using a diode, a transistor, multiple wires, and a resistor.</p></td>
