    <tr>
        <td><p>This system was created by code, microbit, and a servo. With three wires I connected each one (signal, power, ground) to their degsinated pins on the microbit. This then powers the microbit through my code showcased to the right(also includes code for ceiling fan because I only used one microbit). Through different inputs my microbit follows different sequences.</p></td>

    <td><p>Here, is a picture of my circuit. I connected the encoder of the servo to Pin 0, the power wire of the servo to pin 3V, and the ground pin to GND. That's essentially how my servo works.</p></td>
