    <tr>
        <td><p>This system was created by code, a microbit, a servo, a speaker and 2 breadboards. The mini breadboard was used on the outside to connect the mircobit and speaker to the breadboard on the indie which contains the LEDS and servo. The yellow LED is connected to PIN 2 and when the servo is connected to PIN, so when button a is pressed the servo will turn 90 degrees, wait 5 seconds and rotate back to 0 degrees. The speaker is connected to the PIN 8 so when the micro bit is shaken it plays a sound an that sound can be turned off by pressing buttons A+B. </p></td>

    <td><p>This is what the system looks like as a whole. On the exterior is a mircobit that connects to a servo on the inside so if you press button A it will open the door and close it automatically, on the inside when button A is pressed it will also turn on the light. The light is a simple circuit on the breadboard connected to pin 2.   </p></td>

    <td><p>The alarm/earthquake system will activate if the mircobit is shaken. The system consists of a speaker on the outside and a flashing red LED on the inside to warn anyone inside the house. This is helpful for when someone tries to enter the house with out pressing the microbit to open the door and it will scare them off. It is more effective as an earthquake detector since it will detect the motion and warn people. To turn off the alarm all you have to do is press buttons A+B together. </p></td>
