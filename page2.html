    <td><p>Here, is a picture of my circuit. I connected the encoder of the servo to Pin 0, the power wire of the servo to pin 3V, and the ground pin to GND. That's essentially how my servo works. Then, with my <bold>neat</bold>wire management skills, I taped it towards the wall of my house to prevent loose and messy wires. It then escapes through a minature gap in the attic door, lets the servo sit on the floor of the third floor, and controls that door. It's a very capable design, with many functions.</p></td>
